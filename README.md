# ChromeOS_Whisper
Run Whisper AI Model on ChromeOS

Change Log:

Initial commit of project

Process:

* Setup Chromebook in developer mode (this wipes all data)

* Setup Linux Subsystem with 12GB of space.

* Install Anaconda

* Install a Microphone Recorder tool like `Voice Recorder` which saves `WAV` and `MP3` files. (MP3 runs faster with Whisper). Recordings save to `Play Files\Recordings`.

* Open the [Whisper Notebook](Whisper.ipynb)
